                <h3>The System and Box in our life</h3>
                <p>
                    Have you ever thought about the system and box in our life? <br>
                    I have thought about it. 
                    I mean the system is the social system, the system of the world. <br>
                    The box is contain our mindset and freedom. <br>
                    The system is the rules, the laws, the way of life. <br>
                    The box is the way we think, the way we see the world. <br>
                    One of the most example is the education system. We have put in the system that we do the things that we don't want.
                    We have to study the things that we don't like. That is system.
                    That cause our mindset is limited. We can not imangine the world outside the box. 
                    Then we stuck in the trend of social and demand of people. <br>
                    I am stopping it and I am trying to break the old system and the box that ruin my life.
                    Now I am doing the things that I like. I am learning the things that I want.
                    I am trying to break the box that limit my mind. <br>
                    Then one day I will understand what is <q>Freedom</q> means. I know that many people out there are doing the same thing.
                    And well, Hello, I have join the club. <br>
                    Hello world, I am Le Trung Thanh. I am a fresher Frontend Developer. <br>
